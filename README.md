# Wuilmar Matias-Morales - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This was made using **React.js** to showcase my work keeping in mind performance, accessibility and responsiveness. In this website, you will be able to see my work as a front-end web designer and developer.

## Features: 

This portfolio features a responsive layout built with React.js and Styled Components. It includes smooth page animations using Framer Motion. You can see these used on the home page as well as for the profile photo in the About Me Section. We also used a modular component structure with the NavBar, Footer and Project Card all being reusable commponents. The contact form contains validation in which you can only submit once completed. This is all combined with React Router bringing all the pages together. Each project is displayed with GitHub and live demo links. It is coded so that if no link for GitHub or site than no button will appear. Finally, the site is deployed using Vercel for fast, modern delivery. You can view the live demo above.
